        <p id="overviewPar1">
          Imagine you want to sell your bike to a fellow UMass student. First,
          you make a post on Snapchat with a single image of your bike, and set
          a vague price-point. Now, your story is posted in the middle of a
          string of 5 frat party ads and a lost-and-found post. A couple days
          later, you have 2 buyers, and both of them are lowballing you. After
          an hour of negotiating in between classes, you finally land on a
          price. One small problem: your buyer lives in Southwest, and you are
          in Sylvan. Tragic.
        </p>
        <p id="overviewPar2">
          Fortunately, there's a solution: ZooBuy. Our app provides a central
          location for both buyers and sellers to network with each other and
          find the best prices for their items. Since our app is exclusive to
          UMass, students can feel comfortable sharing more private information
          on the app, like their dorm location and class schedule. Our app will
          also allow people to rate and review the items that they buy so that
          other users can see who is and is not a reputable seller.

          ZooBuy, the envisioned online marketplace tailored for the UMass
          community, hinges on adept data management to ensure smooth
          transactions and user interactions. At its core, ZooBuy will curate a
          robust database of listings, each encapsulating crucial details like
          item descriptions, pricing, images, and seller contacts. This
          structured approach to data organization enables users to effortlessly
          navigate through a plethora of offerings, fostering a seamless
          browsing experience.
        </p>
        <p id="dataPar2">
          User profiles stand as pivotal data entities within ZooBuy's
          ecosystem. These profiles encapsulate pertinent personal information,
          including user names, contact details, and potentially profile
          pictures, alongside a repository of transaction histories. By
          maintaining a comprehensive record of user activities, ZooBuy enhances
          user engagement and fosters a sense of accountability among its
          community members.
        </p>
        <p id="dataPar3">
          In tandem with user profiles, ZooBuy will implement a sophisticated
          messaging system to facilitate communication between buyers and
          sellers. This messaging infrastructure will store dialogue threads,
          encompassing both sent and received messages, thus enabling effective
          interaction and negotiation. Such a feature not only streamlines the
          transaction process but also nurtures trust and transparency within
          the marketplace.
        </p>
        <p id="dataPar4">
          Integral to ZooBuy's functionality is the management of payment
          information. Ensuring the secure handling of payment details during
          transactions is paramount. Integration with reputable payment gateways
          such as Venmo or Apple Pay will furnish ZooBuy with the capability to
          execute secure and seamless transactions, elevating the overall user
          experience and instilling confidence among its users.

          As current college students, we know first-hand the amount of stuff
          that gets thrown out or discarded each year. By creating ZooBuy, we
          aim to reduce the amount of waste created by UMass students by
          encouraging them to sell items to others rather than throwing them
          away. The real-world impact of this app is the prevention of trash
          waste and promotion of sustainability efforts.
        </p>
        <p id="realPar2">
          Allowing students to easily sell their items means there will be less
          items thrown away to dumpsters and tossed to the side of the road at
          the end of the academic year. From personal experience using Ebay,
          sellers are inclined to sell items because they can make money back on
          past purchases, and users are inclined to buy from others for good
          discounts. Moreover, there are many ways students buy and sell items
          through Facebook marketplace or YikYak, but those communities are
          disparate and unorganized. ZooBuy localizes its users to students in
          Amherst, and the added rapport of being students builds reputability
          and trust between buyers and sellers. Creating a local buy and sell
          app is also convenient for users because shipping distance is shorter
          and students can elect to meet in person to exchange items and money.
        </p>
        <p id="realPar3">
          With ZooBuy, students can be confident that the items they no longer
          need will find their way to those who do need them, rather than a
          landfill. The added convenience of our app being limited to verified
          UMass students makes this a safe, seamless experience.

          Our 326 group project is the culmination of a UMass education in
          Computer Science as it is an opportunity to harness our technological
          abilities to compute for the common good. As students at UMass
          Amherst, we live in a walkable community of young and bright students
          in the Amherst area with access to education, dining, and community.
          An education in computer science is an education in critical thinking,
          learning programming, mathematics, and problem solving. In past
          semesters, we completed courses in programming from object oriented
          design to data structures to the one and only programming methodology
          with Marius Minea. Conversely, we also take courses in calculus,
          probability and statics, and linear algebra to give a theoretical
          background to the mathematical concepts we come across in programming
          such as arrays and higher order functions. Up until this point in our
          education, we have focused on theoretical concepts such as logic and
          truth, through this project we will be able to apply our classroom
          learnings into a group project that integrates theory with hands-on
          experiences. Thus, an education in programming and mathematics fosters
          critical thinking and problem solving to harness and learn new
          technologies and frameworks to create web applications, apps, and gain
          insights and make informed decisions from data.
        </p>
        <p id="IEPar2">
          Our project, a ZooBuy website, stems from student demand to live
          lighter given the constraint of living in a dorm/away from home.
          Unlike living at home, living on your own in a temporary location
          means students often bring more things than they need to school and
          buy more items over time. As a result, many students end up with too
          many items and want to sell them. Given the large university
          population, students looking to sell items will benefit from a ZooBuy
          app that allows student sellers to connect with other students for a
          mutually beneficial relationship where one student sells an item they
          no longer need and the other receives a discounted item. In sum, our
          web application ZooBuy draws from insight on the needs of the campus
          and our technical skills in computer science to create something
          innovative and fun.
