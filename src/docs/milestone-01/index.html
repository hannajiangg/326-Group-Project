      <h2 id="overviewHeading">Project Overview</h2>
      <p id="overviewPar1">
        Imagine you want to sell your bike to a fellow UMass student. First,
        you make a post on Snapchat with a single image of your bike, and set
        a vague price-point. Now, your story is posted in the middle of a
        string of 5 frat party ads and a lost-and-found post. A couple days
        later, you have 2 buyers, and both of them are lowballing you. After
        an hour of negotiating in between classes, you finally land on a
        price. One small problem: your buyer lives in Southwest, and you are
        in Sylvan. Tragic.
      </p>
      <p id="overviewPar2">
        Fortunately, there's a solution: ZooBuy. Our app provides a central
        location for both buyers and sellers to network with each other and
        find the best prices for their items. Since our app is exclusive to
        UMass, students can feel comfortable sharing more private information
        on the app, like their dorm location and class schedule. Our app will
        also allow people to rate and review the items that they buy so that
        other users can see who is and is not a reputable seller.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="application-parts">
      <h2 id="appPartsHeading">Important Parts of the Application</h2>
      <!-- These should probably be converted to paragraphs like Tim's example -->
      <p id="partsPar1">
        To verify that an account is owned by a UMass student, our registration requires a umass.edu email address that
        will be associated with each account.
        To verify ownership of this email, our app will send a verification email for users to prove that they own an
        account.
        During registration, we also give users the option to opt into 2-factor authentication using Microsoft
        authenticator.
        Once users are verifies and logged in, they can begin shopping and selling!
      </p>

      <p id="partsPar2">
        Choosing what to buy is hard, and it's even harder with bad UI.
        That's why the first page users see when they log in is a grid of items currently being sold.
        Each entry shows the user a large image of what is being sold, captioned with the quantity remaining, the price,
        the seller, and the name of the item.
        The large thumbnails and informative captions allow users to quickly decide on an item they want to buy, making
        the shopping experience seamless.
      </p>

      <p id="partsPar3">
        However, users also need a way to filter for the specific type of item that they need.
        This is where the search feature comes into play.
        Using the Elasticsearch API, our search feature allows users to find exactly what they're looking for using
        natural-language queries, greatly simplifying the search process.
        Each listing also has a set of tags that users can search by, allowing queries for more specific things like
        certain models of electronics or specific clothing sizes.
      </p>

      <p id="partsPar4">
        Once users decide on what they want to buy, our app provides a list of useful features to simplify the process
        of payment and transportation.
        Firstly, our mobile-friendly and easy-to-use direct messaging feature allows users to communicate to sellers on
        the go if any problems arise while receiving packages.
        In addition, we included a publicly visible section on each user profile to list payment information, such as
        Venmo, to make the process of payment as smooth as possible.
        With these features, users can easily pay for the items they want to purchase, and quickly and conveniently
        communicate with sellers if they encounter any problems receiving their items.

      <h2 id="dataReqsHeading">Data Requirements</h2>
      <p id="dataPar1">
        Zoobuy deals with a wide range of data, ranging from sensitive user data to responsive real-time messages.
        As such, ZooBuy needs a robust and efficient data infrastructure in order to provide a responsive and secure
        experience to users.
        In particular, ZooBuy needs to manage listings, user profiles, messaging, and payment information.
      </p>

      <p id="dataPar2">
        From seller listings to marking sold items, an efficient and effective method of keeping track of listings and
        purchases is a necessity.
        At its core, Zoobuy will curate a robust database of listings, each encapsulating crucial details like item
        descriptions, pricing, images, and seller contacts.
        This structured approach to data organization enables users to effortlessly navigate through a plethora of
        offerings, fostering a seamless browsing experience.
        We envision a robust home page that functions as a local marketplace: displaying recent listings, curated items,
        and direct messaging.
      </p>

      <p id="dataPar3">
        User profiles stand as pivotal data entities within Zoobuy's ecosystem.
        These profiles encapsulate pertinent personal information, including user names, contact details, and
        potentially profile pictures, alongside a repository of transaction histories.
        By maintaining a comprehensive record of user activities, Zoobuy enhances user engagement and fosters a sense of
        accountability among its community members.
        We plan to integrate a user-friendly UI that allows users to quickly navigate the information and details they
        are seeking.
      </p>

      <p id="dataPar4">
        In tandem with user profiles, Zoobuy will implement a sophisticated messaging system to facilitate communication
        between buyers and sellers.
        This messaging infrastructure will store dialogue threads, encompassing both sent and received messages, thus
        enabling effective interaction and negotiation.
        Such a feature not only streamlines the transaction process but also nurtures trust and transparency within the
        marketplace.
        By hosting our own direct messaging service, we allow the user more ease in negotiating buy and sell
        transactions, as well as provide users with a centralized locale for a userâ€™s Zoobuy needs.
      </p>

      <p id="dataPar5">
        Integral to Zoobuy's functionality is the management of payment information.
        Ensuring the secure handling of payment details during transactions is paramount.
        Integration with reputable payment gateways such as Venmo or Apple Pay will furnish Zoobuy with the capability
        to execute secure and seamless transactions, elevating the overall user experience and instilling confidence
        among its users.
      </p>

      <p id="dataPar6">
        With a solid data infrastructure, our app provides a seamless experience to users while also keeping hosting
        costs low.

      <h2 id="realWorldHeading">Real-World Connection</h2>
      <p id="realPar1">
        As current college students, we know first-hand the amount of stuff
        that gets thrown out or discarded each year. By creating ZooBuy, we
        aim to reduce the amount of waste created by UMass students by
        encouraging them to sell items to others rather than throwing them
        away. The real-world impact of this app is the prevention of trash
        waste and promotion of sustainability efforts.
      </p>
      <p id="realPar2">
        Allowing students to easily sell their items means there will be less
        items thrown away to dumpsters and tossed to the side of the road at
        the end of the academic year. From personal experience using Ebay,
        sellers are inclined to sell items because they can make money back on
        past purchases, and users are inclined to buy from others for good
        discounts. Moreover, there are many ways students buy and sell items
        through Facebook marketplace or YikYak, but those communities are
        disparate and unorganized. ZooBuy localizes its users to students in
        Amherst, and the added rapport of being students builds reputability
        and trust between buyers and sellers. Creating a local buy and sell
        app is also convenient for users because shipping distance is shorter
        and students can elect to meet in person to exchange items and money.
      </p>
      <p id="realPar3">
        With ZooBuy, students can be confident that the items they no longer
        need will find their way to those who do need them, rather than a
        landfill. The added convenience of our app being limited to verified
        UMass students makes this a safe, seamless experience.

      <h2 id="intExpHeading">Integrative Experience</h2>
      <p id="IEPar1">
        Our 326 group project is the culmination of a UMass education in
        Computer Science as it is an opportunity to harness our technological
        abilities to compute for the common good. As students at UMass
        Amherst, we live in a walkable community of young and bright students
        in the Amherst area with access to education, dining, and community.
        An education in computer science is an education in critical thinking,
        learning programming, mathematics, and problem solving. In past
        semesters, we completed courses in programming from object oriented
        design to data structures to the one and only programming methodology
        with Marius Minea. Conversely, we also take courses in calculus,
        probability and statics, and linear algebra to give a theoretical
        background to the mathematical concepts we come across in programming
        such as arrays and higher order functions. Up until this point in our
        education, we have focused on theoretical concepts such as logic and
        truth, through this project we will be able to apply our classroom
        learnings into a group project that integrates theory with hands-on
        experiences. Thus, an education in programming and mathematics fosters
        critical thinking and problem solving to harness and learn new
        technologies and frameworks to create web applications, apps, and gain
        insights and make informed decisions from data.
      </p>
      <p id="IEPar2">
        Our project, a ZooBuy website, stems from student demand to live
        lighter given the constraint of living in a dorm/away from home.
        Unlike living at home, living on your own in a temporary location
        means students often bring more things than they need to school and
        buy more items over time. As a result, many students end up with too
        many items and want to sell them. Given the large university
        population, students looking to sell items will benefit from a ZooBuy
        app that allows student sellers to connect with other students for a
        mutually beneficial relationship where one student sells an item they
        no longer need and the other receives a discounted item. In sum, our
        web application ZooBuy draws from insight on the needs of the campus
        and our technical skills in computer science to create something
        innovative and fun.
